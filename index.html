<h3><a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Intro</h3>

<p>These examples use <a href="http://threejs.org/">three.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/">ammo.js</a>(ammo is a javascript port of the <a href="http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/">bullet</a> physics engine) and <a href="https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO">socket.io for flask</a>(python).  The examples that use flask require you to run a local server using the server.py file in the examples directory.  You'll need to have flask and flask-socketio python packages.  For the client side the you'll just need to include <a href="https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client">socket.io</a> javascript file which you can get <a href="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/1.3.5/socket.io.min.js">here</a>. </p>
        
<h3><a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/reliableJARED/static/example1.html" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example 1</h3>
<p></a><a href="https://reliablejared.github.io/WebGL/templates/example1.html">View Example</a> <br>This SUPER SIMPLE demo will make a cube and drop it into a world with nothing (not even ground!).  You'll see gravity pull the cube down.  The source code has loads of comments to explain each part.  You can view the source </a> javascript file which you can get <a href="https://github.com/reliableJARED/WebGL/blob/gh-pages/static/js/example1.js">HERE</a>.  The intent is just to show minimalist code for creating objects with ammo.js and three.js.</p>


<h3><a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/reliableJARED/static/example2.html" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example 2</h3>
<p></a><a href="https://reliablejared.github.io/WebGL/templates/example2.html">View Example</a> <br>This expands on Example 1. Adds ground for our cube to fall on as well as shadow to the world.  The shadows come from adding a directional light source and enabling shadows in our renderer as well as on our objects. </a> javascript source code with comments can be found <a href="https://github.com/reliableJARED/WebGL/blob/gh-pages/static/js/example2.js">HERE</a>.</p>


<h3><a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/reliableJARED/static/example3.html" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example 3</h3>
<p></a><a href="https://reliablejared.github.io/WebGL/templates/example3.html">View Example</a> <br>This examples shows how to to select and move an object which has physics enabled.  You can't just 'teleport' objects in bullet (ammo.js) you need to use the setWorldTramsform method of an object and update it's location in the world.  Also, objects 'fall asleep'.  There are 5 flags that bullet use to determine if objects can move.  If a moveable object doesn't move for about 2 seconds it won't be able to move again unless an object in motion collides with it.  That mean our select and reposition won't work right unless we update the flag to 'active'. </a> javascript source code with comments can be found <a href="https://github.com/reliableJARED/WebGL/blob/gh-pages/static/js/example3.js">HERE</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/reliableJARED/static/example4.html" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example 4</h3>
<p></a><a href="https://reliablejared.github.io/WebGL/templates/example4.html">View Example</a> <br>This example shows how to apply a force to an object.  When the users holds down spacebar an upward force (think rocket engine) will be applied to our cube.  It also has shows a nice way to embed one object in another for nice neat code.  There is a 'flame' cone that you'll see coming from the cube as it blasts off.  that is our embedded graphic only object.

<h3><a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/reliableJARED/static/example5.html" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example 5</h3>
<p></a><a href="https://reliablejared.github.io/WebGL/templates/example5.html">View Example</a> <br>This example shows how to break an object apart based on an impact force, and remove it from the world.  It continues from the previous examples except that now if our cube hits the world with a large force (drops from sky).  It will break into rubble.  The rubble also has a built in timer so it cleans up after a few seconds.  Otherwise we would litter the world with rubble if we had many of these objects.  The timer uses javascript promises if you don't know what they are look them up.  It's a way to do asynchronous stuff.  <a href="https://github.com/reliableJARED/WebGL/blob/gh-pages/static/js/example5.js">HERE</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/reliableJARED/static/example6.html" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example 6</h3>
<p></a><a href="https://reliablejared.github.io/WebGL/templates/example6.html">View Example</a> <br>This example adds a button to add cubes to the world.  It also adds a 'break force' to the objects.  If they are struck with a force greater than their break force the object will fracture into rubble.  The rubble has a random delay which causes to be removed from the world after a few seconds.  This example also adds a new camera mode.  You can follow the 'rocket block' by holding down the F key. <a href="https://github.com/reliableJARED/WebGL/blob/gh-pages/static/js/example6.js">HERE</a>.</p>
 
  
<h3><a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/reliableJARED/static/example7.html" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example 7</h3>
<p></a><a href="https://reliablejared.github.io/WebGL/templates/example7.html">View Example</a> <br>This example introduces a gui using an overlaying second canvas element.  It also supports touch and mouse events.  Setup of the GUI becomes difficult because we need to manage click events now and really track where the users input (mouse or touch) is and respond differently depending.  The gui puttons are javascript promises.  there is a gui function that builds the frame and then new buttons are added.  A few additional global variables are used to track the GUI.  Going forward we'll need to clean up the global name space.  One other thing is that the same click event handler is used for touch or mouse.  we use a single flag to indicate if it's a touch device or not.  then in the click functions events for touch events are converted to event[0] as touch events are in an array (you can have more than one finger touch the screen) while a mouse is a single object.  There are lots of notes in the code that you can see <a href="https://github.com/reliableJARED/WebGL/blob/gh-pages/static/js/example7.js">HERE</a>.</p>
